This is my first post, Am I excited?? 
Well I don't know.. Mixed feeling, confusion, excitement and nervousness are going on in my mind. From 2 weeks, I decided not to smoke and drink but unfortunately, I didnt follow it.. 

Aaj ek baar or Khosis krne k dil keh raha h.. 
dil keh raha h.. Ruk jao!! abi b waqt h.. sudhar jao.. 
zindgi h un haseen palo ko is dhue me mt uda nalaylk..
ban ja layak warna der na legegi bnte khalnayak. 


bus inhi kuch lines k sath aj i will smoke for the last time before starting this challenge.. Reason why am i smoking is just bcz i want to write the first thought in the blog bneing high.. I know after sometime if i continue this blog everyday, I will definately laugh at my own but I believe its necessary now.. I really need to release al my thoughts, all negative energy.. 
Job b bathein h mere mann me, sb likhunga or khud s poochunga k is this what i really want??
